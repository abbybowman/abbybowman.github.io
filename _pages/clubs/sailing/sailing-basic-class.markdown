### About the class

The class consists of 3 two hour long online sessions and 4 water lessons.
The book is provided as part of the class. This year we are using "The Complete Sailor" by David Seidman.
The Classroom notes and handouts will be available on the website noted above before the class starts. The pages listed are from the book. Due to copyright issues images of those pages can't be posted.

You will sign up with a water instructor at the first class. Generally there will be three students to each water instructor. The schedule for the water lessons will be coordinated with your instructor and your fellow crew members. The water instructor will be responsible for all the water lessons and your water test.

If you feel you have adequate sailing experience to get qualified without the class, Doug can put you in contact with one of the "qualifiers".
