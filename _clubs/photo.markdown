| 10   | Meeting     | **Unleash your creativity (Lori Lankford)**   | **TBD**                   | Lori Lankford brings a refreshing approach to photography, making it fun, simple, and creative. She has a passion for teaching and mentoring photographers at all levels to develop their unique style and vision. Her personal English garden, transformed from bare dirt into a thriving floral paradise over the past three years, serves as both a creative workspace and a source of inspiration for her photography.

This technique uses predominantly white or light tones throughout the composition, creating an image that appears bright, airy, and often optimistic or uplifting.

### Committees

We are starting to expand our Club's committees. We are looking for Club Member volunteers to help out on these committees. The more volunteers we have the less work for any one person, and the more opportunities available to Club members. So many opportunities are coming our way and the Club board members cannot handle it all. That means we miss those opportunities... to learn, to exhibit, and to participate in photo events.

- **Exhibits**  
  Organize the Showcase, Building 1 Cafeteria exhibit, and coordinate external opportunities like Riversdale, Greenbelt Arts Center, etc.  
  *Wayne Robinson (lead)*

- **Education**  
  Coordinate the learning opportunities for the club: workshops, classes, bringing in speakers. Share the external educational events that may be happening in our region.  
  *Bill Dusterwald (lead)*

- **MPA**  
  Attend MPA meetings and distribute MPA information/opportunities to the Club members.  
  *Scott Hull (lead)*

- **Field Trips**  
  Coordinate and/or organize field trips and recruit others to lead them. Get the word out about the field trips. Help field trip leaders with logistics planning.  
  *Brent Warner (lead)*

- **Outreach**  
  Get the word out about the Club. Post regular Dateline messages and coordinate flyer distribution/mounting ahead of events. Respond to requests for photo support (green screen, other GEWA clubs, etc.)  
  *Need volunteers!*
