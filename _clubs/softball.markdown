Since the early 1960â€™s, softball fans at Goddard have enjoyed playing from spring through fall with the **Goddard Slow-Pitch Softball Association (GSPSA)**, often with family members joining in games and tournaments. In the spring and summer, the GSPSA offers leagues on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, with increasing levels of competition at the week moves forward. In the fall, a single league is formed with many fun activities provided throughout the season. 

The leagues are open to GSFC employees and retired employees, contractors, and immediate family members of eligible players. The club offers a provision for a minimal number of guests of eligible players to join the teams too! And, the club operates a concession stand before, during, and after games where you can get many of your favorite food and drink items that are often associated with baseball. The fields are conveniently located along Beaver Dam Road to the east of Soil Conservation Road.
